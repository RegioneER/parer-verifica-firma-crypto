|CVE-2021-35516|apache-commons-compress: excessive memory allocation when reading a specially crafted 7Z archive|When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.|High|Upgrade org.apache.commons:commons-compress to 1.21|
|CVE-2021-35517|apache-commons-compress: excessive memory allocation when reading a specially crafted TAR archive|When reading a specially crafted TAR archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' tar package.|High|Upgrade org.apache.commons:commons-compress to 1.21|
|CVE-2021-36090|apache-commons-compress: excessive memory allocation when reading a specially crafted ZIP archive|When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs.

|CVE-2016-2175|pdfbox: XML External Entity vulnerability|Apache PDFBox before 1.8.12 and 2.x before 2.0.1 does not properly initialize the XML parsers, which allows context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted PDF.|High|Upgrade org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox to 1.8.12, 2.0.1|
|CVE-2017-12626|poi: Parsing of multiple file types can cause a denial of service via infinite loop or out of memory exception|Apache POI in versions prior to release 3.17 are vulnerable to Denial of Service Attacks: 1) Infinite Loops while parsing crafted WMF, EMF, MSG and macros (POI bugs 61338 and 61294), and 2) Out of Memory Exceptions while parsing crafted DOC, PPT and XLS (POI bugs 52372 and 61295).|High|Upgrade org.apache.poi:poi to 3.17|
|CVE-2021-40690|xml-security: XPath Transform abuse allows for information disclosure|All versions of Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java prior to 2.2.3 and 2.1.7 are vulnerable to an issue where the "secureValidation" property is not passed correctly when creating a KeyInfo from a KeyInfoReference element. This allows an attacker to abuse an XPath Transform to extract any local .xml files in a RetrievalMethod element.|High|Upgrade org.apache.santuario:xmlsec to 2.1.7, 2.2.3|
|CVE-2016-4434|tika: XML External Entity vulnerability|Apache Tika before 1.13 does not properly initialize the XML parser or choose handlers, which might allow remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via vectors involving (1) spreadsheets in OOXML files and (2) XMP metadata in PDF and other file formats, a related issue to CVE-2016-2175.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.13|
|CVE-2018-11761|tika: XML entity expansion vulnerability due to lack of limit configuration|In Apache Tika 0.1 to 1.18, the XML parsers were not configured to limit entity expansion. They were therefore vulnerable to an entity expansion vulnerability which can lead to a denial of service attack.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.19.1|
|CVE-2018-11796|tika: Incomplete fix allows for XML entity expansion resulting in denial of service|In Apache Tika 1.19 (CVE-2018-11761), we added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing. However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika versions from 0.1 to 1.19 are therefore still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack. Users should upgrade to 1.19.1 or later.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.19.1|
|CVE-2018-1335|tika: Command injection in tika-server can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers|From Apache Tika versions 1.7 to 1.17, clients could send carefully crafted headers to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running tika-server. This vulnerability only affects those running tika-server on a server that is open to untrusted clients. The mitigation is to upgrade to Tika 1.18.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.18|
