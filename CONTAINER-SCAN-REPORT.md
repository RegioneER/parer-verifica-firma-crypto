|CVE-2022-26280|libarchive: an out-of-bounds read via the component zipx_lzma_alone_init|Libarchive v3.6.0 was discovered to contain an out-of-bounds read via the component zipx_lzma_alone_init.|High|No solution provided|
|CVE-2022-0778|openssl: Infinite loop in BN_mod_sqrt() reachable when parsing certificates|The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).|High|Upgrade openssl-libs to 1:1.1.1k-6.el8_5|

|CVE-2021-35516|apache-commons-compress: excessive memory allocation when reading a specially crafted 7Z archive|When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.|High|Upgrade org.apache.commons:commons-compress to 1.21|
|CVE-2021-35517|apache-commons-compress: excessive memory allocation when reading a specially crafted TAR archive|When reading a specially crafted TAR archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs.

|CVE-2016-2175|pdfbox: XML External Entity vulnerability|Apache PDFBox before 1.8.12 and 2.x before 2.0.1 does not properly initialize the XML parsers, which allows context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted PDF.|High|Upgrade org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox to 1.8.12, 2.0.1|

|CVE-2021-40690|xml-security: XPath Transform abuse allows for information disclosure|All versions of Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java prior to 2.2.3 and 2.1.7 are vulnerable to an issue where the "secureValidation" property is not passed correctly when creating a KeyInfo from a KeyInfoReference element. This allows an attacker to abuse an XPath Transform to extract any local .xml files in a RetrievalMethod element.|High|Upgrade org.apache.santuario:xmlsec to 2.1.7, 2.2.3|
|CVE-2016-4434|tika: XML External Entity vulnerability|Apache Tika before 1.13 does not properly initialize the XML parser or choose handlers, which might allow remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via vectors involving (1) spreadsheets in OOXML files and (2) XMP metadata in PDF and other file formats, a related issue to CVE-2016-2175.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.13|
|CVE-2018-11761|tika: XML entity expansion vulnerability due to lack of limit configuration|In Apache Tika 0.1 to 1.18, the XML parsers were not configured to limit entity expansion. They were therefore vulnerable to an entity expansion vulnerability which can lead to a denial of service attack.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.19.1|
|CVE-2018-11796|tika: Incomplete fix allows for XML entity expansion resulting in denial of service|In Apache Tika 1.19 (CVE-2018-11761), we added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing. However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika versions from 0.1 to 1.19 are therefore still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack. Users should upgrade to 1.19.1 or later.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.19.1|
|CVE-2018-1335|tika: Command injection in tika-server can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers|From Apache Tika versions 1.7 to 1.17, clients could send carefully crafted headers to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running tika-server. This vulnerability only affects those running tika-server on a server that is open to untrusted clients. The mitigation is to upgrade to Tika 1.18.|High|Upgrade org.apache.tika:tika-core to 1.18|
